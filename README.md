# contactsApp_angularjs
The Contacts App has been created using AngularJS.

## To run:
 - clone repository
 - run 'bower install'
 - run 'npm install'
 - run 'grunt serve'. This will start a local server on port 9000

 ## To test:
  - If the grunt server is already running, hitting save on any js file will automatically run the test
  - An alternate way is to open another terminal/cmd window and run 'grunt test'
  - The test runs in the terminal/cmd window (headless) and that's where the results are shown. It briefly opens a small chrome window that shows the test is running but closes when the test stops.
